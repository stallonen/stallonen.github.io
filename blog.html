    \(\Huge\text{On identity elements of algebraic structures.}\)
    $$$$
    \(\large \text{A question that has been eating at me for a few days is, why do we need an identity element for certain algebraic structures like groups, rings, fields?}\)
    <br>
    \(\large\text{Say, we consider the structure \((\mathbb{N},+)\). It fails to be an abelian group because it lacks an identity element. Hence an additive inverse. }\)
    <br>
    \(\large \text{    However it might be considered a loop. Is it just that we're considering different structures? }\)
    <br>
    \(\large\text{    Perhaps an argument is that, we're studying different structures and group is just a structure equipped with an identity element. }\)
    <br>
    \(\large\text{Question}\).
    <br>
    \(\large \text{Is, \(\mathbb{F}=\{0,1\}\), equipped with \((\mathbb{F},+,.,1,0)\) a field?}\)

    \(\Huge\text{A look at Nesbitt again.}\)
    <br>
    <br>
    \(\large \text {In my blog, I talked about a proof of nesbitt's inequality in a very elementary setting.I would like to show another proof of the inequality here. }\)
    <br>
    \(\large \text{We define \(s=(a+b+c)\), and then define a function \(f(x)=\frac{x}{s-x}\).This function is convex on \([0,s]\). Prove it}\). 
    <br>
   \(\large \text{Invoking Jensen's inequality on the function, gives us }\)
    <br>
    \(\large~\sum_\text{cyclic}\frac{a}{s-a}\geq\frac{3}{2}\text{,replace \(s\) with \( a+b+c\) and we get}\)
    
   \(\large~\sum_\text{cyclic}\frac{a}{b+c}\geq \frac{3}{2}\text{ hence done}\).
   <br>
   \(\large \text{   I know more proofs of this inequality and I will post with time. }\)
