    \(\huge\text{On identity elements of algebraic structures.}\)
    $$$$
    A question that has been eating at me for a few days is, why do we need an identity element for certain algebraic structures like groups, rings, fields?
    <br>
    Say, we consider the structure \((\mathbb{N},+)\). It fails to be an abelian group because it lacks an identity element. Hence an additive inverse. 
    <br>
    However it might be considered a loop. Is it just that we're considering different structures? 
    <br>
    Perhaps an argument is that, we're studying different structures and group is just a structure equipped with an identity element. 
    <br>
    \(\text{Question}\).
    <br>
    Is, \(\mathbb{F}=\{0,1\}\), equipped with \((\mathbb{F},+,.,1,0)\) a field?
